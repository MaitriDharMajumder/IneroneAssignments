        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (called the \"superclass\" or \"base class\"). This mechanism facilitates code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes. Here's a more detailed explanation of inheritance and its purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reusability:** Inheritance enables us to create a new class by inheriting attributes and methods from an existing class. This means we don't have to rewrite the same code in multiple places, which promotes code reuse and maintenance. Instead, we can extend the functionality of existing classes as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hierarchy and Organization:** Inheritance allows us to create a hierarchy of classes, with more specific (sub)classes inheriting from more general (super)classes. This hierarchy reflects the \"is-a\" relationship, where a subclass is a specialized version of its superclass. For example, we might have a superclass called \"Animal\" and subclasses like \"Dog\" and \"Cat,\" which are more specialized forms of animals.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** Inheritance is closely tied to polymorphism, another OOP concept. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means we can write code that works with objects at a higher level of abstraction, making our code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method Overriding:** Subclasses can override methods inherited from their superclass. This means a subclass can provide its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass, tailoring it to its specific needs. Method overriding is essential for achieving different behaviors in subclasses while maintaining a consistent interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is commonly used to model real-world relationships and hierarchies in software development. It helps create well-structured, organized, and maintainable code by promoting code reuse and ensuring a consistent structure for related classes.\n",
